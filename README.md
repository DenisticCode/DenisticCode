# ALL ABOUT ME

Hello, I am DenisticCode! I have joined joined Github becaues I found it would be cool to share all my work and help people with problems associated with coding. I mainly specialise in Minecraft related work.
I help people out with, creating custom items, learning how to configure plugins through .yml files and I also work with plain vanilla Minecraft commands. 

I am a gamer and have been playing minecraft ever since 2019. Minecraft has become more and more interesting as I learned code and new amazing addons to Minecraft.
My aim to everyone is to help people out with Minecraft related challenges that require coding.
